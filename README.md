# BasicAssLanguage
BAL (basic ass language) is an attempt to create a language and interpreter or compiler using java. Don't expect much from it

# When to Expect Progess?
As of the creation of this file (November 27 2023), im still in school and flooded with work.

I also have other projects i want to work on (most notably my data structures library and client/server stock market simulation).

At the very earliest, the project should start close to or just after Christmas 2023.

# What Even is This?
Im trying to create a programming language that can do very simple tasks, such as
- print to the console
- basic math functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc)
- loops maybe?
- variables

To be honest, i don't know what im doing and i dont have a plan, nor do i have the time to think about this right now
